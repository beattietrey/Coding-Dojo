# Tech Interview Prep

1. Most Tech Interviews are solving algorithms, not to determine whether you are able to solve the problems, but to view HOW you solve it. 

1. Interview is usually a: 
    1. A non-technical screening call
    1. A hackerrank test
    1. Skype Interview
    1. An on-site interview (about 2.5 - 4 hours)

1. Teams grade on a rubric or scoring guide 
    1. Communication and clarifying question are important
    1. Complexity is tested as well (www.bigocheatsheet.com)
    1. Write proper code, i.e. syntax, indentations

1. Be ready to support choices and offer technical difficulties you dealt with

1. Have steps for your problem solving strategy
    1. Start by restating the question, so that you can ask clarifying questions and make sure you have a clear understanding
    1. Take any hints, if you hear them talking, pay attention! Restate what they say and consider it, implement it if you can do it, if you don't let them know. 
    1. If you are stuck and they aren't offering help, use collaborative questions to have them guide you i.e Do you think I am going in the right direction?
    1. Pseudo code everything, they will be looking for it
    1. Brute force first, then optimize from there
    1. Test before you commit: Talk through the problem, T-table, run provided tests, go through your solution line by line. This helps prevent stupid mistakes, makes you confident when your interviewer asks if it is correct, shows that you are detail oriented
    1. No matter what happens, end on a positive note, and network. That gives you the option to ask for advice and areas to study
