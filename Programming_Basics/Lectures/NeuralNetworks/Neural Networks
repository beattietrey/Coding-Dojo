Day 1.

"A farmer goes to the market, and purchases a wolf, a goat, and some wheat.

On his way back from the market, he comes across a river, and a boat. The
problem is, the boat can only hold the farmer and 1 of his purchases at a 
time. In addition, he can't leave the wolf and goat together, or else the 
wolf will eat the goat, and he can't leave the goat and the wheat together,
or the goat will eat the wheat.

Your Building Neural Network challenge for today is to figure out how the 
farmer could get all 3 to the other side without losing any of them in as 
few trips as possible."


Goat First, then wheat, bring back goat, bring over wolf, bring over goat?
    4 trips
