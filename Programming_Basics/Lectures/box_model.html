<!-- Box Model

Padding and border both take up space within the box. Adding a border to content will be adding on top of the padding, whereas an outline will fill into the padding

You can add an outline to the * { }  to see where the outer edge of things

ex. 
*{
    outline: 2 px dotted red;
}

It also helps to use the * { } to reset css settings on any browser to make sure different browsers don't react differently.
