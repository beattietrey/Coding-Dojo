            <p>If you want to get to know me, the first thing you have to understand is that I care about 5 things in this world.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>My girlfriend, Megan.</li>
                <li>My dogs, Mischief and Padfoot.</li> 
            </ol>
            <p>And in no particular order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Booze</li>
                <li>Board Games</li>
                <li>Actually, let's just call that games.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>I don't know if there is much more I can tell you, than this. I worked in the restaurant industry for over a decade before Covid hit, and shut everything down, so I am finally making the transition into a new field, that hopefully won't be impacted by something like that again.</p>
