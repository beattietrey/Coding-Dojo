<!--Using comments, write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem.
    Using comments, create pseudo-code to apply one of the strategies to solve the problem. 
    Using comments, write a short paragraph that answers: What is the hardest part of problem-solving?  -->

<!--The first strategy I can think of for solving this problem, would be to find out which pronouns are most common in the paragraph.
    If the paragragh contains more "me," "I," or "we" words, it would be first person.
    If the paragraph contains more "you" or "your" words, it would be second person.
    If the paragraph contains more "he," "she," "they," or "it" words, it would be third person -->

<!-- The first step to write this code would be a function, with a parameter that would allow the paragraph to be set for the argument of the function -->
function perspectiveCheck(paragraph) {
<!-- The next step would be setting variables for word counts for each of the pronouns -->
    var firstCount = 0;
    var secondCount = 0;
    var thirdCount = 0; 
<!-- The next step would be setting up a for loop that runs through the string. -->
    for(var i = 0; i < paragraph.length; i++) {
<!-- The next would be figuring out how to search for specific words in the code -->
<!-- I would then count each instance of the words -->
        if(paragraph[i] == "I" && paragraph[i-1] == " " && paragraph[i+1] == " ") {
            <!-- looking for instances of I -->
            firstCount++;
        }
        if(paragraph[i] == "h" && paragraph[i-1] == " " && paragraph[i+1] == "e" && paragraph[i+2] == " ") {
            <!-- looking for instances of "he" -->
            thirdCount++;
        }
        <!-- etc... -->
    }
        <!-- Then I would need to use if statements to determine which pronouns are more prevalent in the paragraph -->
    if(firstCount > secondCount && firstCount > thirdCount) {
        console.log("First Person Perspective")
    }
    if(secondCount > firstCount && secondCount > thirdCount) {
        console.log("Second Person Perspective")
    }
    if(thirdCount > firstCount && secondCount > thirdCount) {
        console.log("Third Person Perspective")
    }
}

<!-- The hardest part about problem solving is figuring out how you need to approach the situation in the first place. You have to have a plan of attack for how you will start the process or you won't be able to break it down into smaller steps. Once you have a plan, then it's only about figuring out how to do each step, which is a much easier thing. -->
