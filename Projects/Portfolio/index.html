        Hi! My name is Trey. I spent most of my professional career in the
        food-service industry, with a focus on bartending and management. When
        Covid-19 hit, I realized that the stability of the industry was not as
        firm as I was hoping, so I decided that it was time to make a switch to
        a different field. Programming and coding have always piqued my
        interest, falling very close to two of my favorite things, Nerd Culture
        and Gaming. With that in mind, I set out on a journey to immerse myself
        in them. I took the plunge and signed up for a Coding Bootcamp that I
        had been eyeing, called Coding Dojo. I am currently in the program and
        fleshing out my skills, so that I can find my place in the Development
        field. I am excited to see what I can build!
